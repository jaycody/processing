####Overview 
Back to basics, like Rocky's Russian training regime montage in RockyIV - pullups in a snow covered barn.  Time to trade in the 3-4 month high-profile Processing project loop for the 3 minute high-speed prototype iteration drills. 

And then top it off with some redemption via refactoring.  Yes, finally I will roll through my ITP Processing archives -- refactoring and updating --  a [former] grad student's wish fulfilled.  

So as to retain the records of my wild eyed tromp through 2 years of Processing training at NYU's ITP 2010-2012, I've included in this current repository only the copies of my ITP Processing sketch archives.  The original archive repositories remain intact on github (ITP-ICM, ITP-NOC, ITP-Arduino, ITP-ComputationalCameras).  Now I'm free to refactor, uncruft, and update my pre-school finger paint level attempts at Object Oriented Programming.
